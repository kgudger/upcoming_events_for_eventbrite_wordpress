This plugin will create a list of upcoming events from your eventbrite account.

Set your EventBrite App Key and organizer ID.

Currently the plugin only displays the next 3 events.

Use the shortcode "eventbrite_upcoming_events" to render the events.
[upcoming_events_for_eventbrite]

Optionally, you can specify the maximum number of events to display using the max_count. Default is 3.
[upcoming_events_for_eventbrite max_count="2"]
